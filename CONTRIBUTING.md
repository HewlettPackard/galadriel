# Contributing to the Galadriel Project

The change management process for the Galadriel Project is designed to be transparent, fair, and
efficient. Anyone may contribute to a project in the galadriel repository that they have read access
to, provided they:

* Abide by the SPIFFE [code of conduct](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
* Can certify the clauses in the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/main/DCO)

To get started:

* First, [README](/README.md) to become familiar with how the Galadriel Project is managed
* Make sure you're familiar with our [Coding Conventions](#conventions) when appropriate

## Sending a pull request

1. Fork the repo
2. Commit changes to your fork
3. Update the docs, if necessary
4. Ensure your branch is based on the latest commit in `main`
5. Ensure all tests pass (see project docs for more information)
6. Make sure your commit messages contain a `Signed-off-by: <your-email-address>` line (see `git-commit --signoff`) to certify the [DCO](/DCO)
7. Make sure your all your commits are GPG-signed
8. Open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)
   against the upstream `main` branch

All changes to galadriel project must be code reviewed in a pull request (this goes for everyone, even
those who have merge rights).

## After your pull request is submitted

Pull requests are approved according to the process described in our [governance
policies](/GOVERNANCE.md). At least two other contributors  must approve the pull request.

Once your pull request is submitted, it's your responsibility to:

* Respond to reviewer's feedback
* Keep it merge-ready at all times until it has been approved and actually merged

Following approval, the pull request will be merged by the submitter of the pull request.
